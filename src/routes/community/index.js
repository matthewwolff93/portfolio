      <b>Coach</b>
      <p>After spending 6 years of competing in the sport, I decided to give back to the community that had put a lot of time and effort into seeing me succeed. I became a coach and began to quickly acquire the skills of leadership, mentoring, and articulation. In my first year I helped to coach 15 brand new rowers. I had to take charge and teach, both younger and older rowers, the technical and mental skills required of the sport. I was awarded junior coach of the year for my efforts and went on to help at the higher levels. At the senior level I helped coach two of our menâ€™s crews to silver and bronze medals and the New Zealand National Championships.</p>

      <b>Volunteer</b>
      <p>Through my teammates at rowing, I got the opportunity to volunteer at the 2010 Race for Life Track Day. This day gives many of the patients at Mercy Hospice, who suffer from terminal illnesses, the chance to get out and experience the thrills of the race track. We helped them in and out of the cars, brought them food and drink, and talked with them throughout the day. It was important and fulfilling to bring some joy and excitement to the many wonderful people we met that day.</p>
